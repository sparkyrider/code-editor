# Changelog

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-08

### Added

- **GitHub project selector** — Connect to any GitHub repo from mobile chat home (`owner/repo` or full URL)
- **Settings tab on mobile** — Full settings panel accessible from bottom tab bar
- **Native-style tab bar** — Slim iOS-native tab bar with bare icons, labels, and haptic feedback (5ms vibration)

### Changed

- **Mobile tabs curated** — Chat, Editor, Git, Workshop, Settings (dropped desktop-only views: Skills, Prism, Preview, Diff)
- **44px touch targets** — Tab bar buttons meet iOS HIG minimum with `touch-manipulation` CSS
- **Hidden model picker on mobile** — Mode selector (Ask/Agent/Plan) stays, model name hidden to save space
- **Cleaner connect form** — Icon-prefixed inputs (globe + lock), focus rings, always-visible form
- **Mobile header polish** — Dynamic workspace name, smaller connection dot, reduced padding
- **Hidden chat header on mobile** — Saves 40px vertical space; session info available elsewhere
- **"Let's weave" branding** — Aligns with Knot Code identity (weaving/knots metaphor)
- **Minimal composer on mobile** — No branch pill, permissions toggle, or gateway status in toolbar

### Removed

- Suggestion cards on mobile (too cluttered on small screens)
- Open Folder / Clone Repo buttons on mobile (replaced by GitHub project selector)
- Mode switcher in mobile header (redundant with bottom tab bar)
- "Gateway active" status text row (colored dot is sufficient)
- KnotCode footer on mobile
